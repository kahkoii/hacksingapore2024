# VolunteerSpark Webapp

This project was built as part of the hacksingapore hackathon challenge, and aims to make social work sociable, allowing community service volunteers to discover more about what their friends have been up to, whilst providing a platform for them to look for events that may interest them. It allows users to sort upcoming volunteering events by date and categories such as animals, children or environment among others. By the end of the hackathon, the React project was deployed through Surge at the volunteerspark.surge.sh domain.
